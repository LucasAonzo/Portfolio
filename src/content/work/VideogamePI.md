  I developed a video game search web application using React, Redux, Node, Express, and Sequelize. Users can search, filter, sort, and paginate results fetched from the RAWG video game API. They can also view detailed information about each game and create new games stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Project Overview

The primary aim of "VideoGamePI" was to build a Single Page Application (SPA) that consumed the RAWG video game API. This application allows users to:

- **Search for specific video games.**
- **Filter, sort, and paginate results fetched from the API.**
- **View detailed information about each game.**
- **Create new games that are saved to a PostgreSQL database.**

For the backend, Node, Express, and Sequelize were used to connect to the database. API endpoints were established for fetching, filtering, and creating games.

#### Frontend and Backend Details

The frontend was developed with React and Redux to display the user interface and manage the state. The main features include:

- **A landing page.**
- **A game list page with search, filter, and sort options.**
- **A game details page.**
- **A form for creating new games.**

The primary focus of the project was to connect the React frontend with the Node/Express backend and the database using Sequelize. Some of the key learnings from the project were:

- **Consuming a real-world API.**
- **Implementing search, filtering, and sorting.**
- **Building validated forms with JavaScript.**
- **Saving to a SQL database.**
- **Paginating results.**

> In summary, this project provided hands-on experience in developing a full-stack web application using React, Node, and a PostgreSQL database.
